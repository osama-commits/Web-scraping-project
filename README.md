This project utilizes the pandas library to scrape data from the 'Basketball reference' website to find the average points that each NBA player has gained in different matches.

Key points :

*Used the read_html function to parse the content from the website.
*Cleaned the data by removing extra headers from the dataframe.
*Visualised the cleaned data as a histogram to find the average points using the Seaborn library
